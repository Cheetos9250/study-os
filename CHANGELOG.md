# Changelog

## 2026-11-14
- PR #77: course saves/retries check the original saved bytes before writing; conflicting progress remains saved and pending drafts stay exportable. Release `4ae71f8`.
- PR #78: the textbook reader protects other-tab answers, keeps unsaved working exportable and refuses to overwrite unreadable/corrupt initial data. Release `503f8dd`.
- These checks are best effort, not atomic cross-tab transactions or cross-browser sync. No learning content, solution coverage, production data or backend automation changed.
- Validation and release evidence: see PROGRESS.md. Physical iPad/Safari/Files rehearsal remains pending.
