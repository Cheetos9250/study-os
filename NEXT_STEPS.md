# Next steps

## Highest priority
1. Rehearse the published backup → file check → restore flow on physical iPad Safari using disposable data. Repeat for Home Screen/PWA context if used. Chromium/WebKit simulations passed but do not establish real-device behavior.
2. Confirm the actual study browser has a privately saved backup before clearing browser storage or changing devices. The agent has not accessed or backed up real user progress.
3. Perform a separate read-only audit of the live Cloudflare/Notion/scheduler state and backend source availability before claiming automatic or cross-device protection.

## Product work
The basic study, local backup and missing-only recovery workflow is published in PR #53. Keep PR #44 and its branch untouched under the existing instruction; its broader dashboard/planner is separate.

## Verification rules
- Use synthetic data and isolated browser profiles for reset/restore tests.
- For future UI changes, require relevant exact-head CI, inspect responsive screenshots and verify published files after an authorized release.
- No production learning-data write, deletion, cloud migration or Notion sync dispatch is part of UI QA.
